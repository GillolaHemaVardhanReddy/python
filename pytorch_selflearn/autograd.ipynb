    "Autograd stands for automatic differentiation.\n",
    "It’s the part of PyTorch that calculates gradients for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradients are the key to learning — they tell us how much each parameter should change to reduce the loss.\n",

    "If tensors are the “numbers,”\n",
    "autograd is the “brain” that lets those numbers learn."
